# nwalsh-annotations

An annotation library.

This library contains annotations for public consumption. For example,
the `SaxonExtensionFunction` annotation is used by both XML Calabash
and the DocBook XSLT 2.0 Saxon extension functions (quelle surprise).

Putting them in an independent repository limits unnecessary
cross-project dependencies.
