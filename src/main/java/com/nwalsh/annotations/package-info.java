/**
 * "Global" annotations for use in multiple projects.
 * <P>
 * These classes are annotations used, for example, by XML Calabash to find Saxon extension functions.
 * The annotations are shared across multiple projects that might otherwise have no reason to be
 * dependent on each other. Putting them in a separate package means they don't have to be.
